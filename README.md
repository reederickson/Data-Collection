# Data-Collection
# Mars News and Weather Analysis
This project is focused on web-scraping and data analysis of information related to Mars. The project consists of two parts: Part 1 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text. Part 2 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

# Technical Skills
- Webscraping 
- Splinter
- Beautiful Soup
- Data analysis using Pandas
- Plotting charts using Matplotlib

# Weather Analysis
## #1. How many months exist on Mars?
There are 12 months on Mars

## #2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
There are 1867 Martian days worth of data


## #3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Month 3 is the coldest recorded month in Curiosity's location
Month 1 is the hottest recorded month in Curiosity's location


## #4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
Month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure, while month 9 has the highest


## #5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
 There are 687 Earth days in a Martian year. As visualized by the chart, the distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot.


# Project Parameters
- Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)
    - Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup)
    - The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted
    - The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries

- Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
    - The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types
    - The data was analyzed to answer all five listed questions, with data visualizations provided when specified
    - The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file
